MNIST tutorial
=================

This is a tutorial on how to create a simple neural network for hand-written digit recognition. I recommend to review the files in the order:
- MNIST_numpy.ipynb -- contains a full implementation of neural net in numpy including the backpropagation
- MNIST_tensorflow.ipynb -- equivalent neural network as in MNIST_numpy but written in tensorflow.
- MNIST_tf_compact.ipynb -- more compact version of MNIST_tensorflow. 

This is a work in progress. Any feedback is greatly appreciated.
